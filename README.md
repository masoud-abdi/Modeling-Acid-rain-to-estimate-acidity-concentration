# Modeling-Acid-rain-to-estimate-acidity-concentration
In this project, we investigated the acidity concentration by modeling the penetration of gases into water.
For this project, we checked different modes, which are:
    1- We investigated the penetration of gas inside a spherical droplet.
    2- We investigated the penetration of gas into a film.
    3- We considered the penetration of gas inside the water drop as changing with time.
If you have any questions, we will be in touch by my email (masoud abdi 789@gmail.com).
